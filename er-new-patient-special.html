                <p>Dr. Griffith was drawn to Dentistry because it combined two things he has a passion for: helping people and working with his hands. His childhood dentist, Dr. Fred Meece, played an important role in Dr. Griffith’s journey into Dentistry and helped mentor him during his first years in practice. As a child, Dr. Griffith would spend hours painting model cars and small figurines with intricate details, skills that now provide him with the artistry required for Cosmetic Dentistry. As a student, he set his sights on going to medical school. At the last minute, he realized dentistry suited him better and it has been a perfect fit ever since.</p>

                <p>Dr. Jay Alex Hartgrove is originally from Stephens Branch right outside of Martin, KY. He became interested in dentistry in high school, and his passion was solidified early in college after an extended shadowing experience with a local dentist. Dr. Hartgrove attended the University of Kentucky and he completed his undergraduate studies in 2015, graduating Magna Cum Laude with a B.S. in Biology. Dr. Hartgrove then attended the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry and graduated with his Doctor of Dental Medicine degree in 2019.</p>
